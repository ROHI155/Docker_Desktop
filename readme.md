## Introduction
This project covers the fundamentals of Docker, including installation steps, managing Ubuntu images, understanding Docker architecture, and creating and hosting Docker images. Whether you're new to Docker or looking to deepen your understanding, this project provides a structured approach to mastering Docker basics.

## Why Docker?
Docker simplifies application development, testing, and deployment by packaging everything you need into portable containers. This section covers:

### Benefits
- **Consistency**: Docker’s role in creating consistent environments across development, testing, and production.
- **Resource Efficiency**: How Docker saves resources compared to virtual machines.

## Installation
This section includes detailed steps required to install Docker on your machine, guiding you through each step to ensure a smooth installation experience.

### Package Removal
Uninstall any conflicting packages to avoid errors during installation.

### Docker Installation
Commands for adding Docker’s repository, installing necessary packages, and verifying your setup.

## Docker Architecture
This section gives an overview of Docker's architecture, from the Docker CLI to the essential components involved in managing containers and images. Understanding how Docker functions under the hood is key to using it effectively.

### CLI
The Command Line Interface for running Docker commands.

### Docker Daemon
The Docker server that manages containers.

### Containerd & Runc
Core container runtime components that handle container execution and isolation.

## Common Docker Commands
This section provides a quick reference to essential Docker commands for managing images and containers.

### Image Management
- Commands to pull, list, and tag Docker images.

### Container Operations
- Starting, stopping, and interacting with containers in different modes.

## Creating Images
Explore how to create and push custom Docker images to Docker Hub, including details on Dockerfile configuration, tagging, and updating images.

## Creating Images in Java
This section covers creating Docker images specifically for Java applications, such as a basic appointment booking program, and pushing them to Docker Hub.

## Hosting Images
Learn how to pull and run Docker images, manage hosted images like NGINX and HTTPD, and perform port binding and configuration.

## Advanced Operations
Go beyond the basics with advanced Docker operations.

### Detached Mode & Port Binding
- Running containers in the background with specific port configurations.

### Image Tagging and Pushing
- Steps for tagging images and pushing them to Docker Hub for easy sharing.
