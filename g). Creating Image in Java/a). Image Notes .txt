Hey guyzz here we are going to create a simple program for appointment booking 

Our main moto is to create a image on docker and practicing the image creation process

So we are focusing more concentration on Image creation only so only the program is too basic


Algorithm:

 1.Start the program.
 2.Print the welcome Statements.
 3.Import the Scanner Func().
 4.Define the Scanner Func().
 5.print the Key Statements 
 6.Get input from the use using the Scanner function.
 7.Print all the obtained details from the user.
 8.End the program


Image Creation:

For creating Image file asusal we need to frame the Docker File 

Here are the docker file contains the Following.

FROM openjdk:17-jdk-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY img.java .

RUN javac img.java

CMD ["java","img"]

Next we are going to step into the image creation process.

>Building the Image.
// docker build -t details .

>Running the Image file.
//docker run -it details

For Pushing the created Image file to the Docker hub. 

>Creating tag for the created image file.
//docker tag details rohi15/docker_imaging:latest

>Oushing the Image file to the Docker Hub.
//docker push rohi15/docker_imaging:latest
