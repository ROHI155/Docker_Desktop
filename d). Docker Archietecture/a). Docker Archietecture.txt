The Main Component of the docker is Docker's archietecture.

Here we are going to see about how the docker engine's archietecture is performing ?

The Docker Engine contains the three parts,

  Client CLI (Command Line Interface)
  Rest API (Application Programming Interface)
  Docker Daemon (Server)

In the Client command line interface the user can give the commands in the CLI Like (run,rm,save,pull).

Here the API tranfers these commands to the Server (Docker Daemon).

Using this we can manage your containers,image,data Volumes, network.

Here the CLI commads are been processed by thr Docker Daemon.

The containerd is responsible for the creation of 'runc'. 

Accoding to the Number of containers required the runc is also been created.

The runc is responsible for the purpose of creating the containers.

                           Container 2               Nginx               .
                               .                       .               Image n
                           Container n               Image n         
______________________________________________________________________

Here the Containers obtain the image from a repository called registry.

According to that the docker performs based on the request in the CLI.

You can perform the opertions run,pull,stop but once you destroy the container you'll lose the data's in your container.
