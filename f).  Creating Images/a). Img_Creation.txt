Registry, Here the Docker registry contains only the multiple images
Repository, The repository contains the multiple versions of a corresponding Image.

>Here we are going to create a simple image in docker and push it to the Docker hub
 
 for that purpose we are going to create a simple python program in performing the calculator operations.
 
 >Algorithm:(calc Program):

 1. Start the Program.
 2. Define the Operators functions like add,sub,mul,div etc..
 3. In the Dictionary list all the operators you defined above.
 4. Next, Define the calc part to get all inputs and operations to be performed.
 5. Get the input from user.
 6. Get the operation to be performed.
 7. perform the operstion obtained by the user.
 8. Print the result
 9. Stop the Program

 >Creating the Docker File 

 1. From Img_Name
 2. WORK DIR ./LOC (Mainly the ./app is considered as the default working Directory)
 3. COPY Program1.py
 4. CMD ["python","Program.py"]

 Here the Docker log command show the corresponding logs of a image 

//docker logs Containerid or name :: docker logs nginx

To show the details of your docker information

// docker info

For performing the Docker hub actions
To logout from the account that logged in previously

// docker logout

To login a new account using this

// docker login

 To generate the tag of a specific image 

//docker tag $IMG FILE $USER_NAME/REPO_NAME:VER_NAME :: docker tag calcpgm rohi151/docker_imaging:latest

To push the image file to the docker hub

//docker push $USER_NAME/REPO_NAME:VER_NAME :: docker push rohi151/docker_imaging:latest
