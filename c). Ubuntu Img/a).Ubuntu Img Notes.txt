Hey guyzz here the '//' represents cmd lines..

// docker image ls : Lists the all the image file that locally present in your system

// docker run hell-world : It runs the image from the local images if it not present in the local images it download the image from docker hub

 Here let's try it with getting the ubuntu's latest version
 
 Pulling the ubuntu image from the docker hub

 // docker image pull ubuntu:latest

 Running the ubuntu 

 // docker run -it &IMAGE ID &WHAT YOU HAVE TO RUN 

 Here I run the terminal in the host Ubuntu and ,I perform some basic commands in it 
 
 // ps
 // ls
 
 Then I try to ping the google.com it gives error

 bash: ping: command not found

 Here we need to install the ping for that, Firstly we are updating our ubuntu with the following command

 // apt-get update  

 After Updating we need to install the ping command

 // apt-get install -iputils ping

 It will install the ping command. After installing the ping command 

 // ping google.com 

 It pings the google.com
