Hey guyzz the double Quotes represents the command lines

Here the Docker desktop contains all of your running images in it 
If you download any image on Docker it Downloads it on layer by layer only

For Changing the name of the docker 

 // docker run --name $New Name $Img 
 // docker run --name jinx nginx

 It will change the image name.

 Next the comand we are going to see about is to run a image which is detached from our local host.
 Simply it runs at all time.
 
 // docker run -d $img name - It starts the image and detached it
 // docker run -d nginx

When you are running the image it will run and shows the port number also.

But it doesn't available at your local host it runs separately on the container host.In the Docker Desktop it doesn't show the container port number.

To run it on our local host we nee to port bind the image.

//docker run -d -p $SYSTEM PORT:$CONTAINER PORT $IMAGE NAME

// -d detach
// -p port 

eg:
//docker run -d -p 4000:80 nginx

Similarly we can run other image which is been remotely obtained through the docker hub.

> docker pull httpd
> docker run -d httpd
> docker run -d -p 5100:80 httpd

Like that we can perform this in Python, Postgres, Ubuntu etc..
